<p>
I'm currently finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering at Duke University, where I've gained a deep understanding of the underlying principles of computer systems, algorithms, and machine learning as a whole. I'm an aspiring ML engineer and make a point to spend time every day perfecting my craft and learning about where the industry is going. Recent advances in the world of AI show how fast the industry is moving and how quickly responsibilities

Throughout my academic career, I have focused on developing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and DevOps/automation. I've worked on numerous projects exploring the intersection of these interests, which I hope to show any readers who have found themselves looking through my portolio. My expertise includes working with data sets, developing machine learning models, and evaluating model performance.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I've gained practical experience through my internship with the LA Clippers doing data analytics work (summers 2021 & 2022). You can read more about my time with the clippers [here](./clippers.md)




As a dedicated and detail-oriented engineer, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions to complex problems. I'm passionate about using my skills to advance the field of machine learning and contribute to the development of new and innovative technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in machine learning, attending industry events and conferences, and participating in online communities. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to making a meaningful impact as a machine learning engineer.
