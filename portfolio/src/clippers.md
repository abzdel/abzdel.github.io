During my time with the Clippers, I worked on various machine learning and analytics projects. Two of my most prevalent are listed below:

- **Season Ticket Holder Objections**: I analyzed call transcripts from season ticket holders to identify common objections raised by customers. By carefully reviewing these transcripts and using text analytics methods, I was able to uncover recurring themes and patterns in customer objections. This allowed me to provide valuable insights to the company and make recommendations for improving customer satisfaction and retention.

- **Attendance Predictions & Key Variables**: In this project, I deployed machine learning models to analyze key variables that impact attendance at Clippers games. By utilizing data from various sources and employing advanced machine learning techniques, I was able to uncover important insights and patterns in attendance behavior. This information helped the company make data-driven decisions on how to improve attendance rates and optimize their operations.

Additionally, I worked on various ad-hoc requests and more foundational analytics projects. The main analytics project I worked on during my first summer with the Clippers was in regards to **developing a new ticketing model** for the Intuit Dome - the Clippers' new stadium opening in Inglewood for the 2024-25 NBA Season. Here, my team and I proposed a *subscription-based* ticketing model that would be accessible to any fan looking to support the team - not just those with deep pockets.

I'm proud to say that the subscription-based model will be implemented for the first season that the Intuit Dome is in use! By targeting a specific demographic and opening up this opportunity for fans to attend games, we hope to see an increase in Clipper spirit as well as see a $1-2 million increase during the first year of implementation.
