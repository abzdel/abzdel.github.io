## Graduate Cloud Computing for Data w/ Rust first approach

* Heuristic:  Rust if you can, Python if you must
* Refer to these resources when needed:  
    * [Online Book Cloud Computing for Data](https://paiml.com/docs/home/books/cloud-computing-for-data/)
    * [Developing on AWS with C#](https://d1.awsstatic.com/developer-center/Developing-on-AWS-with-CSharp.pdf)
    * [Syllabus](https://noahgift.github.io/cloud-data-analysis-at-scale/syllabus)
    * [Project](https://noahgift.github.io/cloud-data-analysis-at-scale/projects)
    * [New Rust Guide](https://nogibjj.github.io/rust-tutorial/)
    * [GitHub Template Rust New Projects](https://github.com/noahgift/rust-new-project-template)
    * [Rust MLOps Template](https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-mlops-template)
    * [Building Cloud Computing Solutions at Scale Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/building-cloud-computing-solutions-at-scale) **You should refer to this guide often, and this Rust tutorial supplements it**

### Key Goals in Semester

* ~1, 500 Rust projects = 100 Students * 15 Weeks
* Build Resume worthy projects
* Projects should be runnable with minimal instructions as command-line tools or microservices deployed to the cloud

### How to Accomplish Goals

#### Two different demo channels

* Weekly Learning Demo:  Projects can take 10-60 minutes on average to complete (Text only explanation, screencast optional). You must show the code via the link and explain it via `README.md`.
* Weekly Project Progress Demo:  Demo via screencast, required. The demo should be 3-7 minutes.
